# QonnectionsMashup
Mashup example from Qonnections 2015 presentation.

Qlik Sense 1.1 is required. Install as an extension:

- for desktop: copy files to a directory under My Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions

- for server: zip files and install in the QMC

Start with http://localhost:4848/extensions/qonnmashup/qonnmashup.html 
or https://server/extensions/qonnmashup/qonnmashup.html

The mashup will allow you to open any app on your server.

And modify the sort order in visualizations (only works for those based on a hypercube).

Also supports some other operations like applying bookmarks, running a reload, listen to selection state etc.
